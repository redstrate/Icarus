# Icarus

This is an auto-generated library for Rust, based on [EXDSchema](https://github.com/xivdev/EXDSchema/) and [Physis](https://github.com/redstrate/physis). The generator is located [here](https://github.com/redstrate/EXDGen).

**NOTE:** This is still a WIP, the full schema is not supported yet nor is the API finalized.

## Usage
